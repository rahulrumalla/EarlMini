## EarlMini
**EarlMini** or "Url Mini" is a stand-alone Url Shortener Software Solution built on the .NET framework.

The idea behind this project is to provide anyone a full-suite of lightwieght software artifacts to host their own implementation of EarlMini.

Broadly speaking, this suite of artifacts comprise of

1. Core EarlMini Library. ( The NuGet package is coming soon! )
2. The API ( .NET WEB API ) that can be hosted independently to serve 'minification' requests.
3. Lastly, a lightweight website ( .NET MVC ) that merely *expands* the Url and redirects the caller.
